# Docker Swarm with MongoDB replicas installed with Ansible

Currently configuring Swarm Mode and replica set. 

Containers: Ubuntu, Centos, Alpine all latest.

Mongo version 4.4

In every folder there's a Dockerfile and a script that STOPS and REMOVES docker container and then REBUILDS the image and RUNS the container.
